On Day 1,
I selected e-commerce as my marketplace because it offers a wide variety of products and services that can meet different customer needs. E-commerce is growing quickly, and more people are choosing to shop online for everything from daily necessities to special items. It allows businesses to reach more people and operate smoothly. With e-commerce, businesses can manage products, keep track of inventory, and give customers a convenient shopping experience from anywhere in the world. I focused on planning for the marketplace. This involved setting up the project, organizing how it will be built, and installing the necessary tools. I also worked on designing the database and creating a project schema based on my project needs. This schema will help organize the data and ensure everything is connected properly for smooth operation. The main goal was to create a strong base for the project to grow smoothly. 



On Day 2, I focused on designing and building the user interface (UI) of the marketplace. I worked on creating important pages like the product listing page, product details page, and the cart system. The goal was to make the interface simple and easy for users to navigate. I made sure that the product listing displayed all the necessary information clearly, and users could easily view product details when they clicked on an item. I also integrated the functionality that allowed users to add products to their cart. This was important to ensure that the shopping experience was smooth and convenient for users. The main focus was to create an interface that was not only functional but also user-friendly.

On Day 3, I worked with the provided API and migrated it to Sanity, which allowed us to manage the data more easily. After the migration, I connected the API to the website and fetched the necessary data. This data was then displayed on the webpage, ensuring it was shown correctly to the users. One of the key tasks was creating a product detail page, where each product's information, such as its description, price, and other important details, was shown separately. This entire process was dynamic, meaning the data was automatically pulled from the API and displayed on the site without the need for manual updates. The goal was to ensure that the product details were easily accessible and that the website updated automatically when new data was available. 
 
On Day 4, I focused on creating important components for the website that would help improve its functionality and user experience. I worked on the header and footer, which are essential for navigation and providing quick access to key areas of the site. The search bar was added to allow users to easily find products they are looking for. I also worked on the cart page, where users can view the items they have added to their cart before making a purchase. The checkout page was another key component, where users can review their order and enter payment details to complete their purchase. Lastly, I created a help page to provide users with information and assistance when needed. These components were all designed to ensure a smooth and user-friendly experience while using the website.

On Day 5, I focused on testing and improving the website’s functionality. I ran different tests to check both the performance and functionality of the website using tools like Lighthouse. This helped me identify areas where the website could be optimized for faster load times. I also used Thunder Client to validate the responses from the APIs and made sure they were returning the correct data. To ensure the website worked smoothly for all users, I tested its usability across different devices and screen sizes. I implemented error handling for edge cases, which helped prevent problems when users encountered unexpected situations. Finally, I documented all the test cases and created detailed reports to track the website’s progress and ensure everything was functioning as expected.

Finally, on Day 6, I focused on preparing the website for deployment. I set up a staging environment to test the application before going live. I chose Vercel as the hosting platform and made sure the environment variables were configured securely to protect sensitive data. Once everything was set up, I deployed the application to the staging server. In this environment, I ran another round of functional, performance, and security tests to make sure everything worked as expected. I also updated the project documentation and organized all the project files in a GitHub repository for easy access and collaboration. With all tasks completed, the marketplace was ready to be deployed to production.

In summary, the development process involved careful planning, design, implementation, testing, and deployment preparation. On Day 1, the project foundation was set with the repository, structure, and database schema. Day 2 focused on designing a user-friendly interface with product listings, details, and cart functionality. On Day 3, the integration of APIs and data display was completed, with a dynamic product detail page. Day 4 involved creating essential components such as the header, footer, and checkout pages. Day 5 was dedicated to testing, optimizing performance, and ensuring usability across devices. Finally, on Day 6, the staging environment was set up, and the marketplace was deployed, ensuring everything was ready for production.
